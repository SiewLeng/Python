"""
The formula to compute compound interest C for a loan L at the end of n
years at i % interest per annum is as follows:

C = L (1 + i / 100)^n

Write a program that has 3 inputs â€“ loan amount, duration in years and
interest rate. The program displays the compound interest based on the
formula above.
